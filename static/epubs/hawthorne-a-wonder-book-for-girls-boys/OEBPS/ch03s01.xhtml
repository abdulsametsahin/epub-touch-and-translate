have, and brown November likewise, and the greater part of chill
December, too. At last came merry Christmas, and Eustace Bright along
with it, making it all the merrier by his presence. And, the day after
his arrival from college, there came a mighty snow–storm. Up to this
time, the winter had held back, and had given us a good many mild
days, which were like smiles upon its wrinkled visage. The grass had
kept itself green, in sheltered places, such as the nooks of southern
hill–slopes, and along the lee of the stone fences. It was but a week
or two ago, and since the beginning of the month, that the children
had found a dandelion in bloom, on the margin of Shadow Brook, where
it glides out of the dell.</p><p>But no more green grass and dandelions now. This was such a
snow–storm! Twenty miles of it might have been visible at once,
between the windows of Tanglewood and the dome of Taconic, had it been
possible to see so far among the eddying drifts that whitened all the
atmosphere. It seemed as if the hills were giants, and were flinging
monstrous handfuls of snow at one another, in their enormous sport. So
thick were the fluttering snow–flakes, that even the trees, midway
down the valley, were hidden by them the greater part of the time.
Sometimes, it is true, the little prisoners of Tanglewood could
discern a dim outline of Monument Mountain, and the smooth whiteness
of the frozen lake at its base, and the black or gray tracts of
woodland in the nearer landscape. But these were merely peeps through
the tempest.</p><p>Nevertheless, the children rejoiced greatly in the snow–storm. They
had already made acquaintance with it, by tumbling heels over head
into its highest drifts, and flinging snow at one another, as we have
just fancied the Berkshire mountains to be doing. And now they had
come back to their spacious play–room, which was as big as the great
drawing–room, and was lumbered with all sorts of playthings, large and
small. The biggest was a rocking–horse, that looked like a real pony;
and there was a whole family of wooden, waxen, plaster, and china
dolls, besides rag–babies; and blocks enough to build Bunker Hill
Monument, and nine–pins, and balls, and humming–tops, and battledores,
and grace–sticks, and skipping–ropes, and more of such valuable
property than I could tell of in a printed page. But the children
liked the snow–storm better than them all. It suggested so many brisk
enjoyments for to–morrow, and all the remainder of the winter. The
sleigh–ride; the slides down hill into the valley; the snow–images
that were to be shaped out; the snow–fortresses that were to be built;
and the snowballing to be carried on!</p><p>So the little folks blessed the snow–storm, and were glad to see it
come thicker and thicker, and watched hopefully the long drift that
was piling itself up in the avenue, and was already higher than any of
their heads.</p><p>"Why, we shall be blocked up till spring!" cried they, with the hugest
delight. "What a pity that the house is too high to be quite covered
up! The little red house, down yonder, will be buried up to its
eaves."</p><p>"You silly children, what do you want of more snow?" asked Eustace,
who, tired of some novel that he was skimming through, had strolled
into the play–room. "It has done mischief enough already, by spoiling
the only skating that I could hope for through the winter. We shall
see nothing more of the lake till April; and this was to have been my
first day upon it! Don't you pity me, Primrose?"</p><p>"Oh, to be sure!" answered Primrose, laughing. "But, for your comfort,
we will listen to another of your old stories, such as you told us
under the porch, and down in the hollow, by Shadow Brook. Perhaps I
shall like them better now, when there is nothing to do, than while
there were nuts to be gathered, and beautiful weather to enjoy."</p><p>Hereupon, Periwinkle, Clover, Sweet Fern, and as many others of the
little fraternity and cousinhood as were still at Tanglewood, gathered
about Eustace, and earnestly besought him for a story. The student
yawned, stretched himself, and then, to the vast admiration of the
small people, skipped three times back and forth over the top of a
chair, in order, as he explained to them, to set his wits in motion.</p><p>"Well, well, children," said he, after these preliminaries, "since you
insist, and Primrose has set her heart upon it, I will see what can be
done for you. And, that you may know what happy days there were before
snow–storms came into fashion, I will tell you a story of the oldest
of all old times, when the world was as new as Sweet Fern's bran–new
humming–top. There was then but one season in the year, and that was
the delightful summer; and but one age for mortals, and that was
childhood."</p><p>"I never heard of that before," said Primrose.</p><p>"Of course, you never did," answered Eustace. "It shall be a story of
what nobody but myself ever dreamed of,—a Paradise of children,—and
how, by the naughtiness of just such a little imp as Primrose here, it
all came to nothing."</p><p>So Eustace Bright sat down in the chair which he had just been
skipping over, took Cowslip upon his knee, ordered silence throughout
the auditory, and began a story about a sad naughty child, whose name
was Pandora, and about her playfellow Epimetheus.</p><p>You may read it, word for word, in the pages that come next.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/tail07.jpg" alt="Illustration"/></div></section><footer/></body></html>
