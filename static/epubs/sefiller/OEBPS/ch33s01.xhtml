sitting alone on the back side of one of the most solitary slopes in the
Champ–de–Mars. Either from prudence, or from a desire to meditate, or
simply in consequence of one of those insensible changes of habit which
gradually introduce themselves into the existence of every one, he now
rarely went out with Cosette. He had on his workman's waistcoat,
and trousers of gray linen; and his long–visored cap concealed his
countenance.</p><p>He was calm and happy now beside Cosette; that which had, for a time,
alarmed and troubled him had been dissipated; but for the last week or
two, anxieties of another nature had come up. One day, while walking
on the boulevard, he had caught sight of Thenardier; thanks to his
disguise, Thenardier had not recognized him; but since that day, Jean
Valjean had seen him repeatedly, and he was now certain that Thenardier
was prowling about in their neighborhood.</p><p>This had been sufficient to make him come to a decision.</p><p>Moreover, Paris was not tranquil: political troubles presented this
inconvenient feature, for any one who had anything to conceal in his
life, that the police had grown very uneasy and very suspicious, and
that while seeking to ferret out a man like Pepin or Morey, they might
very readily discover a man like Jean Valjean.</p><p>Jean Valjean had made up his mind to quit Paris, and even France, and go
over to England.</p><p>He had warned Cosette. He wished to set out before the end of the week.</p><p>He had seated himself on the slope in the Champ–de–Mars, turning over
all sorts of thoughts in his mind,—Thenardier, the police, the journey,
and the difficulty of procuring a passport.</p><p>He was troubled from all these points of view.</p><p>Last of all, an inexplicable circumstance which had just attracted his
attention, and from which he had not yet recovered, had added to his
state of alarm.</p><p>On the morning of that very day, when he alone of the household was
stirring, while strolling in the garden before Cosette's shutters
were open, he had suddenly perceived on the wall, the following line,
engraved, probably with a nail:—</p><p>16 Rue de la Verrerie.</p><p>This was perfectly fresh, the grooves in the ancient black mortar were
white, a tuft of nettles at the foot of the wall was powdered with the
fine, fresh plaster.</p><p>This had probably been written on the preceding night.</p><p>What was this? A signal for others? A warning for himself?</p><p>In any case, it was evident that the garden had been violated, and that
strangers had made their way into it.</p><p>He recalled the odd incidents which had already alarmed the household.</p><p>His mind was now filling in this canvas.</p><p>He took good care not to speak to Cosette of the line written on the
wall, for fear of alarming her.</p><p>In the midst of his preoccupations, he perceived, from a shadow cast by
the sun, that some one had halted on the crest of the slope immediately
behind him.</p><p>He was on the point of turning round, when a paper folded in four fell
upon his knees as though a hand had dropped it over his head.</p><p>He took the paper, unfolded it, and read these words written in large
characters, with a pencil:—</p><p>"MOVE AWAY FROM YOUR HOUSE."</p><p>Jean Valjean sprang hastily to his feet; there was no one on the slope;
he gazed all around him and perceived a creature larger than a
child, not so large as a man, clad in a gray blouse and trousers of
dust–colored cotton velvet, who was jumping over the parapet and who
slipped into the moat of the Champde–Mars.</p><p>Jean Valjean returned home at once, in a very thoughtful mood.</p></section><footer/></body></html>
