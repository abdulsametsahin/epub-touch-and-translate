One Sunday,
when he went to hear mass at Saint–Sulpice, at that same chapel of the
Virgin whither his aunt had led him when a small lad, he placed himself
behind a pillar, being more absent–minded and thoughtful than usual on
that occasion, and knelt down, without paying any special heed, upon a
chair of Utrecht velvet, on the back of which was inscribed this name:
Monsieur Mabeuf, warden. Mass had hardly begun when an old man presented
himself and said to Marius:—</p><p>"This is my place, sir."</p><p>Marius stepped aside promptly, and the old man took possession of his
chair.</p><p>The mass concluded, Marius still stood thoughtfully a few paces distant;
the old man approached him again and said:—</p><p>"I beg your pardon, sir, for having disturbed you a while ago, and for
again disturbing you at this moment; you must have thought me intrusive,
and I will explain myself."</p><p>"There is no need of that, Sir," said Marius.</p><p>"Yes!" went on the old man, "I do not wish you to have a bad opinion of
me. You see, I am attached to this place. It seems to me that the mass
is better from here. Why? I will tell you. It is from this place, that
I have watched a poor, brave father come regularly, every two or three
months, for the last ten years, since he had no other opportunity and
no other way of seeing his child, because he was prevented by family
arrangements. He came at the hour when he knew that his son would be
brought to mass. The little one never suspected that his father was
there. Perhaps he did not even know that he had a father, poor innocent!
The father kept behind a pillar, so that he might not be seen. He gazed
at his child and he wept. He adored that little fellow, poor man! I
could see that. This spot has become sanctified in my sight, and I have
contracted a habit of coming hither to listen to the mass. I prefer it
to the stall to which I have a right, in my capacity of warden. I knew
that unhappy gentleman a little, too. He had a father–in–law, a wealthy
aunt, relatives, I don't know exactly what all, who threatened to
disinherit the child if he, the father, saw him. He sacrificed himself
in order that his son might be rich and happy some day. He was separated
from him because of political opinions. Certainly, I approve of
political opinions, but there are people who do not know where to stop.
Mon Dieu! a man is not a monster because he was at Waterloo; a father
is not separated from his child for such a reason as that. He was one of
Bonaparte's colonels. He is dead, I believe. He lived at Vernon, where I
have a brother who is a cure, and his name was something like Pontmarie
or Montpercy. He had a fine sword–cut, on my honor."</p><p>"Pontmercy," suggested Marius, turning pale.</p><p>"Precisely, Pontmercy. Did you know him?"</p><p>"Sir," said Marius, "he was my father."</p><p>The old warden clasped his hands and exclaimed:—</p><p>"Ah! you are the child! Yes, that's true, he must be a man by this
time. Well! poor child, you may say that you had a father who loved you
dearly!"</p><p>Marius offered his arm to the old man and conducted him to his lodgings.</p><p>On the following day, he said to M. Gillenormand:—</p><p>"I have arranged a hunting–party with some friends. Will you permit me
to be absent for three days?"</p><p>"Four!" replied his grandfather. "Go and amuse yourself."</p><p>And he said to his daughter in a low tone, and with a wink, "Some love
affair!"</p></section><footer/></body></html>
