near the Halles, notice on their right, opposite the Rue Mondetour, a
basket–maker's shop having for its sign a basket in the form of Napoleon
the Great with this inscription:—</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist" epub:type="list"><tr><td>NAPOLEON IS MADE</td></tr><tr><td>WHOLLY OF WILLOW,</td></tr></table><p>have no suspicion of the terrible scenes which this very spot witnessed
hardly thirty years ago.</p><p>It was there that lay the Rue de la Chanvrerie, which ancient deeds
spell Chanverrerie, and the celebrated public–house called Corinthe.</p><p>The reader will remember all that has been said about the barricade
effected at this point, and eclipsed, by the way, by the barricade
Saint–Merry. It was on this famous barricade of the Rue de la
Chanvrerie, now fallen into profound obscurity, that we are about to
shed a little light.</p><p>May we be permitted to recur, for the sake of clearness in the recital,
to the simple means which we have already employed in the case of
Waterloo. Persons who wish to picture to themselves in a tolerably exact
manner the constitution of the houses which stood at that epoch near the
Pointe Saint–Eustache, at the northeast angle of the Halles of Paris,
where to–day lies the embouchure of the Rue Rambuteau, have only to
imagine an N touching the Rue Saint–Denis with its summit and the Halles
with its base, and whose two vertical bars should form the Rue de la
Grande–Truanderie, and the Rue de la Chanvrerie, and whose transverse
bar should be formed by the Rue de la Petite–Truanderie. The old Rue
Mondetour cut the three strokes of the N at the most crooked angles,
so that the labyrinthine confusion of these four streets sufficed to
form, on a space three fathoms square, between the Halles and the Rue
Saint–Denis on the one hand, and between the Rue du Cygne and the Rue
des Precheurs on the other, seven islands of houses, oddly cut up, of
varying sizes, placed crosswise and hap–hazard, and barely separated,
like the blocks of stone in a dock, by narrow crannies.</p><p>We say narrow crannies, and we can give no more just idea of those dark,
contracted, many–angled alleys, lined with eight–story buildings. These
buildings were so decrepit that, in the Rue de la Chanvrerie and the Rue
de la Petite–Truanderie, the fronts were shored up with beams running
from one house to another. The street was narrow and the gutter broad,
the pedestrian there walked on a pavement that was always wet, skirting
little stalls resembling cellars, big posts encircled with iron hoops,
excessive heaps of refuse, and gates armed with enormous, century–old
gratings. The Rue Rambuteau has devastated all that.</p><p>The name of Mondetour paints marvellously well the sinuosities of that
whole set of streets. A little further on, they are found still better
expressed by the Rue Pirouette, which ran into the Rue Mondetour.</p><p>The passer–by who got entangled from the Rue Saint–Denis in the Rue de
la Chanvrerie beheld it gradually close in before him as though he had
entered an elongated funnel. At the end of this street, which was very
short, he found further passage barred in the direction of the Halles
by a tall row of houses, and he would have thought himself in a blind
alley, had he not perceived on the right and left two dark cuts through
which he could make his escape. This was the Rue Mondetour, which on
one side ran into the Rue de Precheurs, and on the other into the Rue
du Cygne and the Petite–Truanderie. At the bottom of this sort of
cul–de–sac, at the angle of the cutting on the right, there was to be
seen a house which was not so tall as the rest, and which formed a sort
of cape in the street. It is in this house, of two stories only, that
an illustrious wine–shop had been merrily installed three hundred years
before. This tavern created a joyous noise in the very spot which old
Theophilus described in the following couplet:—</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist" epub:type="list"><tr><td>La branle le squelette horrible</td></tr><tr><td>D'un pauvre amant qui se pendit.<a href="#ftn.id1172295725522" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id1172295725522">[47]</sup></a></td></tr></table><p>The situation was good, and tavern–keepers succeeded each other there,
from father to son.</p><p>In the time of Mathurin Regnier, this cabaret was called the
Pot–aux–Roses, and as the rebus was then in fashion, it had for its
sign–board, a post (poteau) painted rose–color. In the last century, the
worthy Natoire, one of the fantastic masters nowadays despised by the
stiff school, having got drunk many times in this wine–shop at the
very table where Regnier had drunk his fill, had painted, by way of
gratitude, a bunch of Corinth grapes on the pink post. The keeper of the
cabaret, in his joy, had changed his device and had caused to be placed
in gilt letters beneath the bunch these words: "At the Bunch of Corinth
Grapes" ("Au Raisin de Corinthe"). Hence the name of Corinthe. Nothing
is more natural to drunken men than ellipses. The ellipsis is the
zig–zag of the phrase. Corinthe gradually dethroned the Pot–aux–Roses.
The last proprietor of the dynasty, Father Hucheloup, no longer
acquainted even with the tradition, had the post painted blue.</p><p>A room on the ground floor, where the bar was situated, one on the first
floor containing a billiard–table, a wooden spiral staircase piercing
the ceiling, wine on the tables, smoke on the walls, candles in broad
daylight,—this was the style of this cabaret. A staircase with a
trap–door in the lower room led to the cellar. On the second floor were
the lodgings of the Hucheloup family. They were reached by a staircase
which was a ladder rather than a staircase, and had for their entrance
only a private door in the large room on the first floor. Under the
roof, in two mansard attics, were the nests for the servants. The
kitchen shared the ground–floor with the tap–room.</p><p>Father Hucheloup had, possibly, been born a chemist, but the fact is
that he was a cook; people did not confine themselves to drinking alone
in his wine–shop, they also ate there. Hucheloup had invented a capital
thing which could be eaten nowhere but in his house, stuffed carps,
which he called carpes au gras. These were eaten by the light of a
tallow candle or of a lamp of the time of Louis XVI., on tables to which
were nailed waxed cloths in lieu of table–cloths. People came thither
from a distance. Hucheloup, one fine morning, had seen fit to notify
passers–by of this "specialty"; he had dipped a brush in a pot of black
paint, and as he was an orthographer on his own account, as well as
a cook after his own fashion, he had improvised on his wall this
remarkable inscription:—</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>CARPES HO GRAS.</p></blockquote></div><p>One winter, the rain–storms and the showers had taken a fancy to
obliterate the S which terminated the first word, and the G which began
the third; this is what remained:—</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>CARPE HO RAS.</p></blockquote></div><p>Time and rain assisting, a humble gastronomical announcement had become
a profound piece of advice.</p><p>In this way it came about, that though he knew no French, Father
Hucheloup understood Latin, that he had evoked philosophy from his
kitchen, and that, desirous simply of effacing Lent, he had equalled
Horace. And the striking thing about it was, that that also meant:
"Enter my wine–shop."</p><p>Nothing of all this is in existence now. The Mondetour labyrinth was
disembowelled and widely opened in 1847, and probably no longer exists
at the present moment. The Rue de la Chanvrerie and Corinthe have
disappeared beneath the pavement of the Rue Rambuteau.</p><p>As we have already said, Corinthe was the meeting–place if not the
rallying–point, of Courfeyrac and his friends. It was Grantaire who had
discovered Corinthe. He had entered it on account of the Carpe horas,
and had returned thither on account of the Carpes au gras. There they
drank, there they ate, there they shouted; they did not pay much, they
paid badly, they did not pay at all, but they were always welcome.
Father Hucheloup was a jovial host.</p><p>Hucheloup, that amiable man, as was just said, was a wine–shop–keeper
with a mustache; an amusing variety. He always had an ill–tempered air,
seemed to wish to intimidate his customers, grumbled at the people who
entered his establishment, and had rather the mien of seeking a quarrel
with them than of serving them with soup. And yet, we insist upon
the word, people were always welcome there. This oddity had attracted
customers to his shop, and brought him young men, who said to each
other: "Come hear Father Hucheloup growl." He had been a fencing–master.
All of a sudden, he would burst out laughing. A big voice, a good
fellow. He had a comic foundation under a tragic exterior, he asked
nothing better than to frighten you, very much like those snuff–boxes
which are in the shape of a pistol. The detonation makes one sneeze.</p><p>Mother Hucheloup, his wife, was a bearded and a very homely creature.</p><p>About 1830, Father Hucheloup died. With him disappeared the secret of
stuffed carps. His inconsolable widow continued to keep the wine–shop.
But the cooking deteriorated, and became execrable; the wine, which had
always been bad, became fearfully bad. Nevertheless, Courfeyrac and his
friends continued to go to Corinthe,—out of pity, as Bossuet said.</p><p>The Widow Hucheloup was breathless and misshapen and given to rustic
recollections. She deprived them of their flatness by her pronunciation.
She had a way of her own of saying things, which spiced her
reminiscences of the village and of her springtime. It had formerly been
her delight, so she affirmed, to hear the loups–de–gorge (rouges–gorges)
chanter dans les ogrepines (aubepines)—to hear the redbreasts sing in
the hawthorn–trees.</p><p>The hall on the first floor, where "the restaurant" was situated, was
a large and long apartment encumbered with stools, chairs, benches, and
tables, and with a crippled, lame, old billiard–table. It was reached
by a spiral staircase which terminated in the corner of the room at a
square hole like the hatchway of a ship.</p><p>This room, lighted by a single narrow window, and by a lamp that was
always burning, had the air of a garret. All the four–footed furniture
comported itself as though it had but three legs—the whitewashed walls
had for their only ornament the following quatrain in honor of Mame
Hucheloup:—</p><table style="border: 0; " class="simplelist" epub:type="list"><tr><td>Elle etonne a dix pas, elle epouvente a deux,</td></tr><tr><td>Une verrue habite en son nez hasardeux;</td></tr><tr><td>On tremble a chaque instant qu'elle ne vous la mouche</td></tr><tr><td>Et qu'un beau jour son nez ne tombe dans sa bouche.<a href="#ftn.id1172295677511" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id1172295677511">[48]</sup></a></td></tr></table><p>This was scrawled in charcoal on the wall.</p><p>Mame Hucheloup, a good likeness, went and came from morning till
night before this quatrain with the most perfect tranquillity. Two
serving–maids, named Matelote and Gibelotte,<a href="#ftn.id1172294728334" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id1172294728334">[49]</sup></a> and who had never been
known by any other names, helped Mame Hucheloup to set on the tables
the jugs of poor wine, and the various broths which were served to the
hungry patrons in earthenware bowls. Matelote, large, plump, redhaired,
and noisy, the favorite ex–sultana of the defunct Hucheloup, was
homelier than any mythological monster, be it what it may; still, as it
becomes the servant to always keep in the rear of the mistress, she was
less homely than Mame Hucheloup. Gibelotte, tall, delicate, white with a
lymphatic pallor, with circles round her eyes, and drooping lids, always
languid and weary, afflicted with what may be called chronic lassitude,
the first up in the house and the last in bed, waited on every one, even
the other maid, silently and gently, smiling through her fatigue with a
vague and sleepy smile.</p><p>Before entering the restaurant room, the visitor read on the door the
following line written there in chalk by Courfeyrac:—</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Regale si tu peux et mange si tu l'oses.<a href="#ftn.id1172295725287" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="id1172295725287">[50]</sup></a></p></blockquote></div><div class="footnotes" epub:type="footnotes"><br/><hr class="footnote-hr"/><div id="ftn.id1172295725522" class="footnote" epub:type="footnote"><p><a href="#id1172295725522" class="para"><sup class="para">[47] </sup></a>There swings the horrible skeleton of a poor lover who
